# **Python-Coding-Journey 🚀🐍**  
_A step-by-step journey from zero to hero in Python_  

## **About This Repository**  
This repository documents my daily Python practice as I build my coding skills from scratch. Each day, I will solve five Python problems, covering basics, data structures, algorithms, and real-world applications. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and coding efficiency.  

## **Topics Covered**  
✅ Python Basics (Syntax, Variables, Data Types)  
✅ Control Flow (Loops, Conditions, Functions)  
✅ Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets)  
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
✅ File Handling & Exception Handling  
✅ Algorithms & Problem-Solving  

## **Daily Progress**  
I will upload my solutions daily, categorized by topic. Each solution will include a problem statement, code, and explanation.  

## **How to Use This Repo?**  
🔹 Clone the repo and explore the solutions  
🔹 Try solving the problems yourself first  
🔹 Compare your solutions with mine and learn new approaches  

## **Let's Code! 🚀**  
Follow my progress and join the journey! Feel free to suggest improvements or new challenges.
